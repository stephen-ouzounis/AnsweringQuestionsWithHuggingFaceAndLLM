How ChatGPT and Plugins are Empowering Citizen Data Scientists?
Citizen data scientists are individuals who do not necessarily have formal training in data analysis or computer science but are able to use data to make informed decisions. ChatGPT and plugins are making it easier for these individuals to analyze and interpret data by enabling them to use natural language. This means they can ask questions and get answers in plain English, without knowing complex programming languages or statistical techniques. ChatGPT will provide the necessary piece of code if needed. In addition, citizen scientists can use ChatGPT as a personal expert who is always available to help them turn their idea into reality.
